## HTML Tags List and Explanation:

!DOCTYPE html: This declaration specifies the HTML version in use, which is HTML5 in this case. It should be at the beginning of every HTML document to specify the HTML version being used.

html: This is the root tag that encloses all HTML content on the page, indicating the beginning of an HTML document.

head: The "head" section contains metadata about the HTML document, such as character set, page title, and links to external style sheets.

meta: The "meta" tags provide additional information about the HTML document. In your case, you used two "meta" tags to set the character set (UTF-8) and viewport configuration.

title: The "title" tag defines the page title displayed in the browser's title bar. It is crucial for search engine optimization (SEO) and helps users identify the page.

link: The "link" tag is used to link external resources to the HTML document. In your case, you used it to link an external style sheet (styles.css) to your document.

body: The "body" tag contains the visible content of the page, such as text, images, and HTML elements. Everything you want users to see on the page should be inside this tag.

header: The "header" tag is used to define the header section of your site, which typically contains elements like logos, navigation menus, and contact information.

nav: The "nav" tag defines a navigation section on your site, usually containing menus or navigation links that help users navigate.

ul and li: "ul" (unordered list) and "li" (list item) are used to create unordered lists. In your case, you used these tags to create an unordered list of navigation menu items.

h1, h2: The "h1", "h2", etc., tags are used to create headers or titles on a page. They indicate the importance and hierarchy of text on the page, with "h1" being the most important title.

img: The "img" tag is used to insert images into the page. You specify the image path in the src attribute and can add alternative text in the alt attribute for accessibility.

p: The "p" tag is used to create paragraphs of text on the page. It separates and formats the text into readable blocks.

a: The "a" tag creates hyperlinks or anchors to other pages or web resources. The href attribute specifies the destination URL for the link.
